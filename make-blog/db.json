Sometimes large amounts in order to properly test them.\n\n\n\nNow I ***could*** enter all of my data manually, but if I have many fields, or need a lot of diversity in my data, that will take forever. \n\n\n\nThe solution: Excel!\n\nLet's instead generate our data by using excel and excel formulas. For this demonstration, i will be using the following data dictionary:\n\n| ID            | first_name     | last_name      | called_by_first  | email          | postcode | gender | DOB  |\n| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------ | ---- |\n| AutoValue INT | Text [VARCHAR[ | Text [VARCHAR] | Yes/No [Boolean] | Text [VARCHAR] | Int      | Char   | Date |\n\n\n\n\nThe ID is easy, we can just use an incrementinfg number. \n\nFirst name is where it starts to get harder...

For example, `=CHOOSE(1, YES, NO)` would give us \"Yes\" and a 2 would give us \"No\".\n\nThis gives us our next function:`=CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,2), YES, NO)`, which randomly gives us either yes or no. \n\nNext, our email.

This is difficult because base demands we must format it with padded zero's (e.g. not 3/4/2022 but 03/04/2022).\n\nFor our day, we can use the following:\n\n`=TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 28), REPT(\"0\", 2))`\n\nWhich says: Join a random number with enough zero's to make it 2 digits wide.\n\nWe can repeat this for the month: `=TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 12), REPT(\"0\", 2))`\n\nAnd the year is fairly simple: `=RANDBETWEEN(1900, 2012)`\n\nThen, we join all of these, making this monster of a formula:\n\n`=CONCAT(TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 28), REPT(\"0\", 2)), \"/\", TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 12), REPT(\"0\", 2)), \"/\", RANDBETWEEN(1900, 2012))`    \n\nNow obviously this has a few holes, such as not including > 28th day of any months, but this is perfectly fine for a bit of \"filler\" data. \n\nSo, to recap, this is our final formula set:\n\n| first_name                     | last_name        | called by first                    | email                                                    | postcode                 | Gender                                   | DOB                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| generator into text to columns | Split first name | =CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,2), YES, NO) | =CONCAT(B2, C2, RANDBETWEEN(10, 99), \"@example.gov.au\")` | =RANDBETWEEN(3000, 3999) | =CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,3), \"M\", \"F\", \"O\") | =CONCAT(TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 28), REPT(\"0\", 2)), \"/\", TEXT(RANDBETWEEN(1, 12), REPT(\"0\", 2)), \"/\", RANDBETWEEN(1900, 2012)) |\n\n","source":"_posts/Generating-large-amounts-of-dummy-data-in-excel.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Generating large amounts of 'dummy' data in excel\ndate: 2022-03-01 12:08:28\ntags: excel, microsoft excel, spreadsheet, data science, data, automation, database, base\n---\n\n\nOften I come across the following problem when designing a database:\n\n\n\nI need to test my queries, but to do that, I need some data.

This has 3 flags, and is rated as \"Moderate\".\n\nThis new CTF boasts several improvements upon the v1, and has the following on the changelog page in the CTF:\n```\nVersion 2\n\nThis version fixed the multitude of security flaws and general functionality bugs that plagued v1. Additionally, we added user authentication; we're still not sure why we didn't think about that the first time, but hindsight is 20/20.

So, why not fix this?\n\nIt turns out pip has a semi-universal config system, meaning that I can simply quickly shop up a script to permanently trust specific hosts. Turns out there are 3 'levels' of config file ([See here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) for the full docs), that load in this order, overwriting eachother:\n\n- Enviroment Variable - Always overwrites everything else\n  \n- Global (All users on system) - Only overwrites User and Global\n  \n- User (just the current user) - Only overwrites Site\n  \n- Site (per enviroment) - Cannot overwrite\n  \n\nNow ideally, I'd write to the *Enviroment Variable*, to prevent a user accidently messing up the fix, however, I want this solution to work for all users, and writing to the Env Var seems to require admin permissions, so I'll settle for the Global config file (`/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf` on MacOS).\n\nSo by simply doing\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /Library/Application\\ Support/pip && printf \"%s\\n\" \"[global]\" \"trusted-host = pypi.python.org\" \"               pypi.org\" \"               files.pythonhosted.org\" > /Library/Application\\ Support/pip/pip.conf || echo \"Failed to create conf file, please run with root permissions and try again\"\n```\n\nI can write the correct config options.\n\nLets break this down, first I do `mkdir -p`, making a new directory, with intermediate folders automatically being created if needed (thus the `-p` option). After that, if the folder creation runs successfully, print the following string:\n\n```\n[global]\n    trusted-host = pypi.python.org \n                   pypi.org \n                   files.pythonhosted.org\n```\n\nAnd then output it to pip.conf (using the `>` redirection character), else if it fails (`||`), then print an error msg.\n\nOk, so now pip is fixed, but theres still 1 annoying issue, anaconda never likes to start up while connected to wifi, on this specific network. To figure this out, I simply opened wireshark before opening anaconda, and tried to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nTurns out, it tries to call home to see if there are any updates avalible, however, if the server does not respond for any reason (say for example, an ssl certificate being self signed and causing an error), it has an insanely long timeout period.\n\nSo, let's fix this!\n\nThe first thing I did, was try to see if there was any ssl documentation, turns out, [there is!](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-repository/admin-guide/install/config/config-reference/#ssl-options) So, all I needed to do, was make a new certificate, append my schools self signed certificate, and I'd be home free!\n\nEasier said than done it turns out...\n\nFirst, I had to download the current, full ssl certificate, I opted to use curl for this:\n\n`curl https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem -o $PWD/.conda.ssl.pem`\n\nAfter downloading it, I next had to fetch woodleighs certificate... once again, easier said than done!\n\nTo do this, I ended up using the fantastic `openssl` client's feature of being able to see the certificates you send and recieve.\n\nThis is the line i came up with:\n\n```bash\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -servername \"curl.haxx.se\" -connect curl.haxx.se:443 | pcregrep -M -e \"----.*(\\n.*){19}\" | pcregrep -M -v -e \"---\\nServer certificate\" >> $b || echo \"Failed to append to new certificate\"\n```\n\nNow, how does that work?\n\nGetting into the openssl `man` page (which is ***STUPID*** long BTW), we can see the `s_client` option does the following:\n\n```plaintext\nThe s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS.\n\n     If a connection is established with an SSL server, any data received from the server is displayed and\n     any key presses will be sent to the server.\n```\n\nSo next, we add the `-showcerts` and `-servername` options, opting to connect to the curl page (ironic, I know), followed by the `-connect` option, specifying what port we would like to connect to in specific (443 for https).\n\nI then pipe (`|`) this to a bunch of pcregrep statements, designed to filter down the last certificate, which, conveniantly, is the school one. I then append (`>>`) that to the certificate sheet (here, stored in the $b variable), otherwise, echo an error command.\n\nI then copy the file to a new location for permanent storage, in particular the $HOME location, named with a dot `.` to make sure the file is non-visable.\n\nI then run 2 sed commands\n\n```bash\nsed -i '' \"s~ssl_verify: true~$c~\" $HOME/$a ||  sed -i '' \"s~ssl_verify: True~$c~\" $HOME/$a\n```\n\nThis repleaces the content `ssl_verify: true` (the default value) with the directory to my custom certificate, basically saying \"use that certificate for ssl verification\". I also run another copy of this searching for a capital T in 'true' just be to sure.\n\nAfter that, everything is patched and the follow should have been fixed:\n\n- Anaconda taking forever to load when connected to the internet\n  \n- Pip Needing an overly complex install cmd (now it should just be `pip install package`)\n  \n\nI am currently investigating the occasional nature of curl to fail, ironically due to a self signed ssl certificate, although I may simply switch to wget instead to avoid this issue.\n\nOn top of that, some installations of anaconda seem to be in different places, without any rhyme or reason, and i'll be investigating this further soon.\n\nThe full script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This script patches both pip and anaconda to not give self-signed cert errors while maintaining an ssl connection.\n# Made by Jake Aronleigh - contact me at: ghostoverflow256@gmail.com\n\necho \"Patching pip first\"\n# This patch tells the pip program to always trust the needed sites through a global config file. \n# The loading order for config files is as follows:\n# Path specified by the PIP_CONFIG_FILE enviroment variable (couldnt get that to work without root)\n# Global - /Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf\n# User - $HOME/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf OR $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf\n# Site - $VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf\n\n# Here I'm using the Global method.

I also run another copy of this searching for a capital T in 'true' just be to sure.\n\nAfter that, everything is patched and the follow should have been fixed:\n\n- Anaconda taking forever to load when connected to the internet\n  \n- Pip Needing an overly complex install cmd (now it should just be `pip install package`)\n  \n\nI am currently investigating the occasional nature of curl to fail, ironically due to a self signed ssl certificate, although I may simply switch to wget instead to avoid this issue.\n\nOn top of that, some installations of anaconda seem to be in different places, without any rhyme or reason, and i'll be investigating this further soon.\n\nThe full script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This script patches both pip and anaconda to not give self-signed cert errors while maintaining an ssl connection.\n# Made by Jake Aronleigh - contact me at: ghostoverflow256@gmail.com\n\necho \"Patching pip first\"\n# This patch tells the pip program to always trust the needed sites through a global config file. \n# The loading order for config files is as follows:\n# Path specified by the PIP_CONFIG_FILE enviroment variable (couldnt get that to work without root)\n# Global - /Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf\n# User - $HOME/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf OR $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf\n# Site - $VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf\n\n# Here I'm using the Global method.

To figure this out, I simply opened wireshark before opening anaconda, and tried to figure out what was going wrong.</p>\n<p>Turns out, it tries to call home to see if there are any updates avalible, however, if the server does not respond for any reason (say for example, an ssl certificate being self signed and causing an error), it has an insanely long timeout period.</p>\n<p>So, let’s fix this!</p>\n<p>The first thing I did, was try to see if there was any ssl documentation, turns out, <a href=\"https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-repository/admin-guide/install/config/config-reference/#ssl-options\">there is!</a> So, all I needed to do, was make a new certificate, append my schools self signed certificate, and I’d be home free!</p>\n<p>Easier said than done it turns out…</p>\n<p>First, I had to download the current, full ssl certificate, I opted to use curl for this:</p>\n<p><code>curl https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem -o $PWD/.conda.ssl.pem</code></p>\n<p>After downloading it, I next had to fetch woodleighs certificate… once again, easier said than done!</p>\n<p>To do this, I ended up using the fantastic <code>openssl</code> client’s feature of being able to see the certificates you send and recieve.</p>\n<p>This is the line i came up with:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">openssl s_client -showcerts -servername <span class=\"string\">&quot;curl.haxx.se&quot;</span> -connect curl.haxx.se:443 | pcregrep -M -e <span class=\"string\">&quot;----.*(\\n.*)&#123;19&#125;&quot;</span> | pcregrep -M -v -e <span class=\"string\">&quot;---\\nServer certificate&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class=\"variable\">$b</span> || <span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">&quot;Failed to append to new certificate&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Now, how does that work?</p>\n<p>Getting into the openssl <code>man</code> page (which is <em><strong>STUPID</strong></em> long BTW), we can see the <code>s_client</code> option does the following:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">The s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS.</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">     If a connection is established with an SSL server, any data received from the server is displayed and</span><br><span class=\"line\">     any key presses will be sent to the server.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>So next, we add the <code>-showcerts</code> and <code>-servername</code> options, opting to connect to the curl page (ironic, I know), followed by the <code>-connect</code> option, specifying what port we would like to connect to in specific (443 for https).</p>\n<p>I then pipe (<code>|</code>) this to a bunch of pcregrep statements, designed to filter down the last certificate, which, conveniantly, is the school one. I then append (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) that to the certificate sheet (here, stored in the $b variable), otherwise, echo an error command.</p>\n<p>I then copy the file to a new location for permanent storage, in particular the $HOME location, named with a dot <code>.</code> to make sure the file is non-visable.</p>\n<p>I then run 2 sed commands</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">sed -i <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span> <span class=\"string\">&quot;s~ssl_verify: true~<span class=\"variable\">$c</span>~&quot;</span> <span class=\"variable\">$HOME</span>/<span class=\"variable\">$a</span> ||  sed -i <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span> <span class=\"string\">&quot;s~ssl_verify: True~<span class=\"variable\">$c</span>~&quot;</span> <span class=\"variable\">$HOME</span>/<span class=\"variable\">$a</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>This repleaces the content <code>ssl_verify: true</code> (the default value) with the directory to my custom certificate, basically saying “use that certificate for ssl verification”. I also run another copy of this searching for a capital T in ‘true’ just be to sure.</p>\n<p>After that, everything is patched and the follow should have been fixed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anaconda taking forever to load when connected to the internet</li>\n<li>Pip Needing an overly complex install cmd (now it should just be <code>pip install package</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am currently investigating the occasional nature of curl to fail, ironically due to a self signed ssl certificate, although I may simply switch to wget instead to avoid this issue.</p>\n<p>On top of that, some installations of anaconda seem to be in different places, without any rhyme or reason, and i’ll be investigating this further soon.</p>\n<p>The full script:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br><span class=\"line\">33</span><br><span class=\"line\">34</span><br><span class=\"line\">35</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#!/bin/bash</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># This script patches both pip and anaconda to not give self-signed cert errors while maintaining an ssl connection.</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Made by Jake Aronleigh - contact me at: ghostoverflow256@gmail.com</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">&quot;Patching pip first&quot;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># This patch tells the pip program to always trust the needed sites through a global config file. </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># The loading order for config files is as follows:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Path specified by the PIP_CONFIG_FILE enviroment variable (couldnt get that to work without root)</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Global - /Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># User - $HOME/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf OR $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Site - $VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Here I&#x27;m using the Global method.
