The first step was to copy the files to ensure that the data was not destructively edited. After this, I used the GNU SED tool to remove specific repeated strings in the output file:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>sed -i &#8221; &#8216;s\/;CO2, VOC\/\/&#8217; data_01.txt<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-i for inplace<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two quotes since this is the OSX version of sed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I construct my search query, with the s switch (for substitution), then use a \/ to separate my query I want to search for, which is \u201c;CO2, VOC\u201d, then another \/ to mark the start of what I want to replace it with, which is nothing, then an ending tag.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then follow this with my file name to replace things inside of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, my terminal looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SS-ARONJ23:data_processing aronj23$ tail data_01.txt\n \n400,0;CO2, VOC\n \n405,0;CO2, VOC\n \n400,0;CO2, VOC\n \n400,0;CO2, VOC\n \n405,0;\n \nSS-ARONJ23:data_processing aronj23$ sed -i '' 's\/;CO2, VOC\/\/' data_01.txt\nSS-ARONJ23:data_processing aronj23$ tail data_01.txt\n \n400,0\n \n405,0\n \n400,0\n \n400,0\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This still leaves me the issue of every second line being a blank line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this I used the following command:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>awk &#8216;NF&#8217; data_01.txt &gt;&gt; data_clean.txt<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where NF is null-field, then use the redirect character, to append to a new file called \u201cdata_clean.txt\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SS-ARONJ23:data_processing aronj23$ awk 'NF' data_01.txt &gt;&gt; data_clean.txt\nSS-ARONJ23:data_processing aronj23$ tail data_clean.txt\n405,0\n400,0\n400,0\n400,0\n405,0\n400,0\n405,0\n400,0\n400,0\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, I repeated this for the rest of the data files from the wetlands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then used \u201ccat file1 file2 file3 &gt; AllData.txt\u201d to make everything into 1 file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then needed to start a database to store this data. To manage this the LibreOffice Base application was used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created a new database, registered it, and then opened it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then created my data dictionary thusly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Name<\/td><td>Type<\/td><td>Desc<\/td><td>Field Properties<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UID<\/td><td>BigInt<\/td><td>A unique identifier as my primary key<\/td><td>Autovalued<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CO2_PPM<\/td><td>Numeric<\/td><td>Carbon Dioxide parts per million<\/td><td>Entry Required = Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VOC_PPB<\/td><td>Numeric<\/td><td>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) parts per billion<\/td><td>Entry Required = Yes<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This was then saved under the name \u201cFreeway\u201d for the sensor beside the freeway.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then installed pbcopy using the brew tool, and used that to attach the data to my clipboard: pbcopy &lt; AllData.txt<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to paste my data into the database, without success. I also tried to use an extension script for base, which didn&#8217;t succeed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, I imported my CSV into a spreadsheet and then simply copy-pasted from there, which worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why I used a database to store my data instead of a CSV. First, a database offers a much more robust way to manage data. I can easily add, remove and update data in a database, and I can also query the data in a variety of ways. Second, a database is significantly more secure than a CSV file, as it can easily be password locked. If my data is stored in a database, it is much less likely to be compromised by a hacker or other malicious actor. Finally, a database is simply a more efficient way to store and retrieve data. With a CSV file, I would have to write code to parse the data out of the file; with a database, I can simply query the data I need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of queries, I\u2019ve prepared a few test queries to implement, in order to test my data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-id=\"284\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Picture-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-284\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-id=\"283\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Picture-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the data is quite varied!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then repeated the data cleaning process for the wetlands, copying the data dictionary over, then again for the sensor at my house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Data analysis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to run a students T test across both my baseline and collected data, which would tell me if my data is statistically significant. To do this, however, I need to do quite a lot of math, which libreoffice base is poorly equiped to handle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installing MySQL<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing MySQL, I then tried to start it, only to get the error \u201cERROR 2002 (HY000): Can&#8217;t connect to local MySQL server through socket &#8216;\/tmp\/mysql.sock&#8217; (2)\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this, I tried just reinstalling, then running `brew service start mysql`, which also didnt work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then tried to go into: \/usr\/local\/opt\/mysql\/bin\/mysql -uroot<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which worked!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then created a new table and tried to link it to my new database through base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brung up an error though, as I had no \u201cuser\u201d other than root.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this I ran:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>CREATE USER \u2018aronj23\u2019@\u2018localhost\u2019;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then connected to verify that account exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After opening the table tab in base though, it said that I didnt have permissions to access that table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this, I then ran:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO \u2018aronj23\u2019@\u2018localhost\u2019 WITH GRANT OPTION;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives my user all permissions!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Importing Data<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I copied over the data tables from my original base file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After linking, I then executed the following commands in MySQL terminal:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SELECT database(); \/\/ list my databases\nuse data; \/\/ Select my database\n\nShow databases; \/\/ List all of my tables\n\nCREATE TABLE Wetlands (UID bigint, CO2_PPM DECIMAL, VOC_PPB DECIMAL); \/\/ create my new wetlands table!\n\nSELECT * FROM Wetlands; \/\/ verify it exists\n\nINSERT INTO Wetlands VALUES (0, 400, 0); \/\/ Insert some test data!\n\nSELECT * FROM Wetlands; \/\/ Get my data\n\n+------+---------+---------+\n| UID  | CO2_PPM | VOC_PPB |\n+------+---------+---------+\n|    0      |     400     |       0       |\n+------+---------+---------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I did forget one thing though, UID should have been auto-increment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this, I dropped the table and recreated it thusly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>CREATE TABLE Wetlands (UID bigint NOT NULL, CO2_PPM DECIMAL, VOC_PPB DECIMAL, PRIMARY KEY (UID)); \/\/ create my new wetlands table!<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And reinsert my data:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>INSERT INTO Wetlands (CO2_PPM, VOC_PPB) VALUES (400, 0);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Verify my recreation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM Wetlands;\n+-----+---------+---------+\n| UID | CO2_PPM | VOC_PPB |\n+-----+---------+---------+\n|   1 |     400 |       0 |\n|   2 |     400 |       0 |\n|   3 |     400 |       0 |\n|   4 |     400 |       0 |\n|   5 |     400 |       0 |\n+-----+---------+---------+\n5 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, to import my data, I need to copy it back to a CSV from my base database to MySQL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, I open a new spreadsheet, Ctrl+C the table, then Ctrl+V into the spreadsheet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, I attempted to use the following query:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>LOAD DATA INFILE \".\/wetlands.csv\" INTO TABLE wetlands FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To which MySQL said: ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the &#8211;secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out, that this is a security feature to try to prevent malicious actions.
